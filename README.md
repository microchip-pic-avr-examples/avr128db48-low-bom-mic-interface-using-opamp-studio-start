# Low-BOM Microphone Interface Using the Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP) Peripheral

</p>

A new feature introduced in the AVR® DB family of microcontrollers (MCUs) is the Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP) peripheral. In this example, the OPAMP peripheral is used to amplify a weak signal up to the 100-millivolt range so that it can be detected by an analog comparator in the MCU or converted to a digital signal by the MCU’s analog-to-digital converter (ADC). 
Up to three internal op amps are available for configuration in the AVR DB. The configuration for this example can be seen in the figure above. Including the MCU the setup uses an external electret microphone, a resistor, and a capacitor. For more information about setup and code, see the [application note](https://microchip.com/DS00003631).
